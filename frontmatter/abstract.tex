        \begin{abstract}
        Everyone loves eating good food. Cooking good food can be extremely tricky requiring a pantry full of food, lots of time, and a recipe. Family recipes are often handed down through word~of~mouth with vague units of measurement, and thus are lost to time. This inspired my idea to compile many recipes that I personally enjoy which predominantly come from my mother and household. Due to this, most dishes will reflect my Chinese-Malaysian heritage, but also the multicultural Australia where I live which is a mixing pot for many cultures.  
            
        It contains some quick \& easy student dishes and also some difficult but worthy for entertaining recipes. These are sourced from my family, friends, and the world wide web. So I'd like to especially thank the many food blogs who post the most delicious recipes for everyone to enjoy.

        This also proved as an opportunity to try out making a cookbook in \LaTeX.
